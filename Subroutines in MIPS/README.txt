Lab 5: Subroutines 
CMPE 012 Fall 2018 
 
Morin, Susanna Sumorin 
------------------------- 
 
What was your design approach? I went to MSI and i talked about big concepts, I referred to the 
Subroutines handout, I watched the lecture on how to push/pop to the stack.

What did you learn in this lab? I best practices and conventions using subroutines, namely that 
I want to save the $sx to the stack so they will not be overwritten in subroutines and similar with the 
$ra.
 
Did you encounter any issues?
I had some very minor issues more my mistakes than any conceptual mistakes. My method was just to go back to the debugger and go step-by-step and also draw lotsof pictures of the stack, tracking the $pc and the $ra making sure changes were happening correctly. Also, the diagram I made helped keep me on track during 
the development of each subroutine. 

Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
The entire lab was enjoyable. Frustrating at time but mostly enjoyable. 
 
How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
I would provide a rubric. I did the Extra Credit because it was a fun challenge and I had all the resources , but I was curious how many points I would be getting. Also, more details on testing and edge cases and whether we need to account for them, I suppose  Icould have asked on Piazza.
