 What was your approach to converting each decimal number to twoâ€™s complement form? 
  For converting the decimal value into a two's compliment number I first converted the ASCII string into decimal form by subtracting 48 from it and then using a flag that would be triggered if program arguments had a negative sign. If so, i would subtract the decimal representation from zero to get a negative number and otherwise I kept as is.
