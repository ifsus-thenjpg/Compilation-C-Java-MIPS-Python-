------------------------- 
 What was your approach to converting each decimal number to twoâ€™s complement form? 
  For converting the decimal value into a two's compliment number I first converted the ASCII string into decimal form by subtracting 48 from it and then using a flag that would be triggered if program arguments had a negative sign. If so, i would subtract the decimal representation from zero to get a negative number and otherwise I kept as is.  
 
 What did you learn in this lab?  
 I learned how stacks work (for the most part) i ended up re-writing my code and using a string instead because i was getting memory issues. I learned that arrays are straight forward and i learned how memory is stored and pointed to.
 
 Did you encounter any issues? 
 I had many many issues. I had issues with figuiring out how to increment the offset, then issues with my stack popping off wrong, then i switched to array and I didnt really have issues there but there were minor issues along the way with small details. 
 
 Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable? 
 Finishing the lab 1 day before deadline with 1 day left to work on extra credit was a great feeling. Feeling like i knew what i was doing felt good too. 
  
 How would you redesign this lab to make it better?  
 I would say more examples on arrays and stacks.
